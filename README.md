### 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a Computer Science student at McMaster University with a strong interest in building practical, real-world software. I’m currently developing my skills in Python, programming fundamentals, and problem-solving, while exploring backend development, automation, and data handling.

I enjoy working on hands-on projects that challenge me to think critically, write clean and maintainable code, and better understand how software systems work behind the scenes. I’m motivated by learning through doing and continuously improving my skills with each project I take on.
